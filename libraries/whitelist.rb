class Whitelist
  # filter takes two arguments - the data you want to filter, and a
  # whitelisted map of the keys you want included. Note we are only using the
  # keys in this hash - if the values are anything other than another hash, we
  # ignore them. (You can't magically morph into a blacklist with "false" as a
  # value in the whitelist.)
  #
  # Whitelist.filter(
  # { "filesystem" => {
  #    "/dev/disk0s2" => {
  #     "size" => "10mb"
  #    },
  #    "map - autohome' => {
  #     "size" => "10mb"
  #    }
  # },
  # {
  #   "filesystem" => {
  #     "/dev/disk0s2" => true
  #   }
  # })
  #
  # Will drop the entire "map - autohome" tree.
